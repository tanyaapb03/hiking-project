# HIKE-FINDER

My goal from this web app was to find the trails near my location and comment on them  to share my experience with other users.

Languages I used in creating this project were: 
> Python
> Javascript  for AJAX and JSON
> HTML
> CSS
> SQL including frameworks such as flask jQuery, Bootstrap, Jinja 

The first page is the login page which  checks with database if the user already exist if they do, then they are redirected to their respective profile and if not they are redirected to sign up page which adds the user to the database.

For my relational database management system, I used Postgresql and SQLAlchemy for my ORM to create multiple number of tables and define relationships between them .

The Hiking project Api which  I used for this project gave me ample amounts of data which I parsed and stored according to project requirements .
